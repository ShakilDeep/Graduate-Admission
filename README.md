This project is about predicting the chance of admission for graduate studies based on various parameters like GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research.

The data was first explored and visualized to understand the relationships between different parameters.

Then, a linear regression model was trained using the training data.

The performance of the model was evaluated using the test data.

The model's predictions were compared with the actual values using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.
The results were visualized using bar plots and scatter plots.
This project provides a practical application of machine learning in the field of education and can be used to help students understand their chances of getting admitted to a particular university based on their profile.
